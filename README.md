# BotLobangMaster
#### The Discount + Promotions reader, parser and analyser. 
#### Retrieves promotions from the web and parses it into the data format that BotHub/TaxiBot can use.

This component of BotHub is served on a separate server on Heroku. Every 6 hours, BotLobangMaster parses and translates promotions and sends them straight to AirTable for the human overlords to perform some quality assurance before sending them to users.
