Original Text: " #CoffeeTip: Love a strong dose of caffeine in the morning? Go for a medium roast! Contrary to popular belief, roasting only brings out the flavour of the beans, but does not make them more potent. In fact, the longer the beans are roasted, the less caffeine they retain. With walnutty notes and a soft fruity aftertaste, our Brazil Single Origin Coffee is the perfect medium roast to start your day with.
